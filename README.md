<h1 align="center"><b> Hi I'm Joram Flores </b></h1>
----
I'm beginning from scratch in my aspirations of becoming an IT professional. The reason I wanted to explore this path is for the sake of securing my place in the future. I'm currently working as a writer/social media specialist for a media organization and I am looking to pursue graduate studies in computer science soon. For now, I'll be working on learning the fundamentals for starters to formally get walking on to this beaten path. That's all for now, I Wish myself best of luck on this journey!
